# Web Devs My 1st Website

Web Devs is a website for people looking to either have a website designed for them maintained or hosted. People who vist this website should be find it easy to naviagte and see that they want. 

# UX Experiance/Design 
when I was thinking of making the site I wanted everything to be simple and easy to navigate so that there wouldn't be any issues I think i managed to pull this off as my site is simple yet conveys its message effectively. i wanted the design to be sleek and not too many colours while being able to express things through pictures and with the layout of my site.

## Technologies used 
As this was my 1st project i only used HTML5 and CSS with the assistance of Gitpod/Github.

## Credits 
For my logos i used on my homepage i was able to get them off wikipedia. as for the picture it was from Pexels. 


## Errors and problems 
I found out that i didnt know how to apply an alt to a background img only later after searching that its just best to add a title to attribuite its attached too which is what i did. 

As for the real errors i only found them when i ran my HTML code through w3c html validator and the w3c css validator although they werent very big mistakes they were minor and easy to fix so i just went back into my code and managed it.
